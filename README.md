# qias_release

This repository contains releases for Quantitative Image Analysis Software (QIAS) packages. This is a public repository. The reason to separate this repository from the development repository is to ensure that no protected health information (PHI) is accidentally released publicly.

Each directory contains a stand-alone project.
